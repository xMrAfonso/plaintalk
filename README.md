# PlainTalk

PlainTalk is a custom programming language designed to make coding accessible to everyone, especially beginners. Our goal is to teach core programming concepts using a simple, natural language syntax that reads like plain English.

### Features

* **Natural Language Syntax:** Write code that is intuitive and easy to read.

* **Instant Feedback:** An integrated console provides real-time output as you run your programs, helping you understand how each line of code works.

* **Beginner-Friendly Editor:** A clean, focused interface with syntax highlighting and clear error messages to guide you.

* **Core Concepts:** Master fundamental programming logic, including variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

### Example

Here's a quick look at what coding in PlainTalk looks like:
```
ask "What is your name?" and store result in name
say "Hello " followed by name followed by "!"

set count to 1
repeat while count is less than or equal to 3:
say "This is iteration " followed by count
add 1 to count
```
